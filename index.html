        This specification document refers to the standards, patterns and examples used for the Verifiable Credential issuance and verification of the educational records requested by a post-secondary institution in Canada. 
        These credentials are issued based on the JSON-LD format as defined by W3C which are cryptographically signed and provide a proof of authenticity. Credentials are issued through a platform (i.e. MyCreds<sup>TM</sup>) and
        verified by various industry partners to enable different services for the students or learners in Canada. This specification provides some reference material, the vocabulary used and the code samples 
        to help the developers community in utilizing the academic credentials.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting
        Verifiable Credentials related to an academic Micro-credential. 
        This vocabulary is intended to be used in conjunction with the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 [[?VC-DATA-MODEL]] specification.

        <h3>Brief about Micro-credential award</h3>
        <p>
          Micro-credential (i.e. MyCreds<sup>TM</sup>) provides learners and graduates access to a secure digital credentials for the 
          academic records. A micro-credential contains the details about the academic certificate, the student name, program, the issuance date etc. 
        </p>

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

        <p>
          There are various use cases that might be helpful for the readers in understating the MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> credential ecosystem. Existing use case covers the JSON-LD format and a basic pattern in issuing and verifying the micro-credentials of an academic record. 
          The university or college accesses the MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> platform and request to issue a Verifiable Credential to the student or learner. The claim of this credential holds the information related to academic certificate, credential owner details and the institution issuing these Credentials.
<!--           
          The use case requirements should be able to cover the the following. 
           <ul>
            <li>Common definitions or characteristics of the academic credential ecosystem</li>
            <li>Roles involved in the academic credential ecosystem </li>
            <li>Common tasks performed by these Roles</li>
            <li>Common patterns and mechanics of interactions </li>
          </ul>   -->
    
        The following use cases outline a number of key scenarios that readers
        might find useful:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Educational Qualification Award</li>
        </ul>

      Following roles are involved in this academic credential ecosystem.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Issuer</b> - University or College as an issuer of micro-credentials</li>
        <li><b>Holder</b> - Student or Learner as the owner of the academic credentials</li>
        <li><b>Industry Partner/Verifier</b> - Industry partners/organizations who are verifying the academic credentials to provide the different services</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
